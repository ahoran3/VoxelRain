#VoxelRain


This is the first project for CAP 4720, Computer Graphics. All code written by Jonathan Cools-Lartigue, Brandon Forster, Matt Hansen, and Alex Horan.


#####The assignment document was as follows:

- To develop a system similar to [Voxel Rain][VR]. We will make some changes to that system. You are welcome to look at the implementation of that system, but you will modify the code implemented in the practice assignments so far.
- Rain drops can be any object: cube, teapot, skull, etc.. chosen interactively (5 points)
- You will use camera, projection, drawables, renderables.
- You will submit a implementation plan. The plan should start with an overview of all the programming components of the project, and then details of how do you plan to complete implementing each component (not the code). (5 points)
- You will use camera rotation to show the rotation effects.
- As always, you will not use any rendering library. You will use you own WebGL and Shader code. I would like to see the use of Drawables, Renderables and Camera from the practice assignments. You may extend them. If you are extending them then documents the changes (as comments in the code).
- You may submit this project as a group. Do mention the group members and who contributed what part of the project.
